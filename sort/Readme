#stability standard of sort olgorithm
1) whether the two same value's sequence was changed. (is: unstability  not: stability) 
2) whether change the sequence of values in distance. (is: unstability  not: stability)
stable sort olgorithm is as following:
1) diretly insert sort
   * olgorethm complexity is O(N*N)
   iteration 1: select the no.2's value as key .(no.1's value is consider as a order sequence)
   iteration 2: for need to change the index with the next value, so 
                need to traverse the list from right to left .
2) bubble sort
   * one of change sort
   * olgorethm complexity is O(N*N)
3) 


unstable sort olgorithm is as following:
1) shell sort
2) quick sort
3) directly select sort
  * olgrethm complexity is O(N*N)
  * select the smallest value to put the first.
  * for need to refresh the smallest value, so should set the value of smallest in the iteration 2 .
  * unstable's reason: change the location by distance, so maybe destroy the ralatively location fo values.
4) heap sort
